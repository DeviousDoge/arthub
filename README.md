## Description

We wanted to create an interactive platform for artists to be able to communicate and collaborate on different projects in one place. There is a home page to view artwork from artists you are following with the ability to like and comment on it. In the description, the user is able to choose a category of art collaboration they would like to have with another artist. For example, a video editor looking for music to add to a film. It also has a login page where you can login to your account and edit your profile to include your website, past artworks posted, and additional personal information.

## Usage

- As a contributing artist, I want to be able to post my art creations, and have it populate my home page.

- As a viewing artist viewing a post, I want to view someone’s home page, and be redirected to a specific post I click on.

- As a viewing artist, I want to be able to make a comment on other artists’ posts and add an emoji reaction.

- As an artist, I want to post my artwork and have my personal contact information in my profile page.

- As an artist, I want to be able to search for other collaborators based on location or art category.
